    <h1>Privacy Policy for RunRelease</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <span class="muted">[Month Day, Year]</span></p>

    <p>RunRelease (“we”, “our”, “us”) helps you unlock selected apps after completing a GPS-tracked run. We minimize data collection and process information on-device whenever possible.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location Data (During Runs Only):</strong> With permission, GPS is used to track distance and route during an active run only. Location access is not used when you are not actively running.</li>
      <li><strong>App Lock Settings:</strong> Your selected apps to lock/unlock, schedules, distance goals, and time windows are stored on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Activity (Screen Time APIs):</strong> With permission, we use Apple’s Screen Time/Device Activity APIs to enforce app restrictions on-device.</li>
      <li><strong>Crash and Diagnostics (Optional):</strong> If enabled via Apple’s system settings, we may receive anonymized crash logs to improve stability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect your name, email, contacts, photos, or other personal identifiers.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Track run progress (distance and route) and determine when to unlock selected apps.</li>
      <li>Enforce your chosen app locks and schedules via Apple’s Screen Time APIs.</li>
      <li>Improve performance and reliability (e.g., diagnostics/crash logs if enabled).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-Device by Default:</strong> Run settings, schedules, and app lock configurations are stored locally on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Location data is used to compute distance/route during active runs; we do not transmit your location to our servers.</li>
      <li><strong>No Account or Cloud Storage:</strong> RunRelease does not operate its own servers for user data storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. We do not share personal data with third parties. If you enable system crash reporting, Apple may provide us with anonymized diagnostics under Apple’s policies.</p>

    <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location</strong> (While Using the App / Precise): To measure distance and route during an active run.</li>
      <li><strong>Motion &amp; Fitness</strong> (optional, if used): To improve activity detection.</li>
      <li><strong>Screen Time/Device Activity:</strong> To enforce app locks until your goal is completed.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications</strong> (optional): To remind you of schedules or run progress.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can change permissions anytime in iOS Settings.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>RunRelease is not directed to children under 13 (or the relevant age in your region). If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use platform security best practices and store data locally when possible. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we work to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>We do not operate servers for user data. Any diagnostics received via Apple crash reporting are handled under Apple’s policies and infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Disable permissions (Location, Screen Time, Motion &amp; Fitness, Notifications) in Settings.</li>
      <li>Delete the app to remove locally stored data on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective Date” above. Material changes may be highlighted in the app or on this page.</p>
